# YLScrollView
A smart custom ScrollView for Android, which is able to measure your inside content length and decide whether a right side vertical text-indicator or graphic-indicator is in need or not. With this ScrollView, compared with default one, users are given a more visualised sign to be noticed that more content are hidden under the visiable part and they have to scroll down to view them.
